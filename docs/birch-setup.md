# PANIC! Birch Setup

On any laptop/tablet with a decent web browser:

- go to the [panic landing page](https://panic.fly.dev/) and click on the big
  red PANIC! button/circle
- if you're not already logged in, log in

Then, in the hallway, turn on the two TV screens (the remotes are "behind" the
TVs). One remote will turn both TVs on/off, but for actually controlling the TV
while it's on you'll need that TV's specific remote.

If the TVs don't go straight to the web browser, then

- go to settings (gear button on remote)
- then navigate to All settings > Apps > All apps > Silk Browser (it might be a
  fair way down)

Once the Silk browser is running, visit

- https://panic.fly.dev/r/204 (on the left-hand TV)
- https://panic.fly.dev/r/224 (on the right-hand TV)

Remember to hit enter once you've typed in the URLs. There will be no feedback
as you type, so you'll have to remember where you're up to. Which sucks,
obviously.

Then, back on your logged-in-to-the-terminal computer, you can start a run by
going to the [terminal page](https://panic.fly.dev/networks/2/terminal) and
input a prompt to kick off a new run (hit enter to start it).

On any other screen/browser you can watch the progress of your run at
<https://panic.fly.dev/networks/2/display/grid/4/5/>

Finally, when you're done, you need to stop it running by going to the
[control panel](https://panic.fly.dev/networks/2/) view and hitting the "Stop"
button (towards the top of the page). If you don't do that PANIC! will keep
running indefinitely, burning through our AI platform credits.

Other notes:

- There might be some delays when you first start the it running with a new
  prompt, because Replicate (where the models are hosted) might need to load
  them into memory. Once they're in there it should pump through the different
  text/image outputs pretty quickly.

- The Vestaboards sometimes get "behind" the TVs. You don't need to do anything
  to fix this, just wait and they'll (hopefully) catch back up.
