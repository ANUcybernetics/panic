## Description

Networks are created with empty models[] by default (in create action), but the validation on update_models prevents empty networks. This creates a conflict where newly created networks cannot be updated with models. 

## Current Issues:
1. Network.create action sets models to [] by default
2. ModelIOConnections validation on update_models rejects empty networks
3. This means you cannot update a newly created network's models from [] to anything else
4. Integration tests fail because they try to update newly created networks

## Potential Solutions:
1. Allow the validation to pass when transitioning FROM empty models TO non-empty models
2. Change the create action to require at least one model
3. Add a separate action for initial model setup that bypasses the validation
4. Modify the validation to only check non-empty model lists
5. **In-memory editing with explicit save** (current approach):
   - Keep validation to ensure DB always has valid networks
   - Work with in-memory representation in UI
   - Show validity indicator (red/green)
   - Explicit "Save" button when valid

## Tests Affected:
- test/panic/validations/network_model_integration_test.exs (all 7 tests failing)
- test/panic_web/live/network_live/model_select_component_test.exs (simplified but may have issues)

## What IS Working:
- Core validation logic (model_io_connections_test.exs - 15/15 passing)
- LiveSelect integration in the component
- Cyclic network validation logic
- Model I/O type checking

## Selected Solution: In-memory editing with explicit save

### Implementation plan:
1. ✅ Keep existing validation unchanged (networks in DB are always valid)
2. ⏳ Modify ModelSelectComponent to work with local state
3. ⏳ Add validity indicator (visual feedback for current state)
4. ⏳ Add explicit "Save" button (only enabled when valid)
5. ✅ Continue allowing empty networks in DB for initial creation

### Implementation Steps:
1. ✅ Modify ModelSelectComponent to maintain draft state  
2. ✅ Port validation logic to client-side
3. ✅ Add visual indicators for validity
4. ✅ Add Save/Reset buttons
5. ✅ Fix validation to allow empty->non-empty transition
6. ✅ Fix test failures by using changesets properly
7. ✅ Update integration tests to reflect new behavior

### Solution Implemented:
- Modified ModelSelectComponent to work with in-memory draft state
- Added validity indicators (green check/red X) and Save/Reset buttons
- Updated validation to allow transition from empty to non-empty networks
- Fixed tests by using `Ash.Changeset.for_update` to properly pass params
- All network model integration tests now passing

### Remaining Work:
- Component UI tests need updating to work with new save/draft pattern
- These tests are failing because they expect auto-save behavior and some try to create invalid networks

**Advantages:**
- Clear separation between draft and persisted state
- Users can experiment without breaking the network
- Database integrity is maintained
- Validation logic remains simple and pure
- No complex conditional validation needed

**Limitations/Considerations:**
1. **UX Change**: Users must explicitly save (currently auto-saves)
   - Mitigation: Clear visual feedback about unsaved changes
   
2. **State Management**: Need to handle discarding changes
   - Mitigation: Add "Reset" or "Cancel" button to revert to saved state
   
3. **Empty Networks**: Still allows empty networks in DB
   - This is actually fine - empty networks can't run anyway
   - NetworkRunner already handles empty networks gracefully
   
4. **Concurrent Edits**: If multiple users edit same network
   - Current: Last write wins (auto-save)
   - New: Explicit save gives user control over when to persist
   
5. **Error Recovery**: If validation fails on save attempt
   - Can show specific errors about which connections are invalid
   - User can fix issues before retrying

**Technical Requirements:**
- Store draft models list in component state
- Run validation client-side for immediate feedback
- Only submit to server when validation passes
- Handle optimistic UI updates vs server responses
