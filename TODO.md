# Panic TODO

- [ ] remove APIToken as separate resource (add a has_many embed to user, managed via user controller)
- [ ] use embeds + cast_assoc, hidden form fields,streams; IOW phoenix it properly
- [ ] Vestaboard module isn't like the others, and should be separated (maybe)
- [ ] ability to use pinned replicate models (maybe even to request the pin)
- [ ] no need for "unauthenticated" route for terminal
- [ ] use the new finitomata test helpers
- [ ] add `admin` field to User
- [ ] add `status` field to Prediction
- [ ] add (virtual) I/O type to Prediction
- [ ] add user profile liveview
- [ ] create `Prediction` on form submit, not just when the API call returns
- [ ] add new views as per the notebook sketches
- [ ] in add model modal, group models by input type
