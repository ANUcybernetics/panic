  Triggers a test crash for Tower error reporting.
  
  This function spawns a background process that crashes after 1 second,
  allowing Tower to catch and report the error via email. This is useful
  for testing error notifications in production via a remote IEx shell.
  
  ## Examples
  
      iex> Panic.trigger_test_crash()
      :ok
      # Error happens in background process after 1 second
