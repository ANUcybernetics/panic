  Triggers a test crash for Tower error reporting.

  This function spawns a background process that crashes after 1 second,
  allowing Tower to catch and report the error via email. This is useful
  for testing error notifications in production via a remote IEx shell.

  ## Examples

      iex> Panic.trigger_test_crash()
      :ok
      # Error happens in background process after 1 second

  """
  def trigger_test_crash do
    IO.puts("\nðŸš¨ Triggering test crash in background process...")
    IO.puts("Check for error notification in a few seconds.\n")

    Task.start(fn ->
      # Wait 1 second to make it clearly async
      Process.sleep(1000)
      timestamp = DateTime.to_string(DateTime.utc_now())
      raise "[PANIC TEST] Tower error notification test triggered at #{timestamp}"
