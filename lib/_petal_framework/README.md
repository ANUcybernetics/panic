This folder is for files and components created and maintained by the Petal team. It's recommended you don't change these files.

We've grouped them to help with upgrading to new releases. Our goal is to leave you with a faily blank template for you to build on, but also give you access to a powerful set of components and utilities to help you get started.

As new versions come out, the upgrade process should be easier as you can copy and paste this folder from the new version.

If you want to modify a file, you can duplicate it and change the module name from "PetalFramework" to "YourApp". Please log an issue in the Repo if a component has a bug or you have an idea to improve it.
